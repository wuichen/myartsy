In the film, Fujiwara and Salley are shown meeting professionals from public relations, advertising, and fashion companies as they seek to construct a new public image for her. Alongside the film, light boxes display fashion photographer Andreas Larsson’s pictures of Salley, which were taken as part of the project to rebuild her profile. While the show tackles public identity, female iconography, and Salley’s voice as an artist, the pair’s close working relationship—one in which the conventional power relationship has been overturned—no doubt aided their collaboration.</p>",

        "_“Capitalist Realism was another form of provocation. This term somehow attacked both sides: It made Socialist Realism look ridiculous, and did the same to the possibility of Capitalist Realism as well.” —[Gerhard Richter](/artist/gerhard-richter)_\n\nCapitalist Realism was launched in 1963 in Germany by the artists [Gerhard Richter](/artist/gerhard-richter), [Sigmar Polke](/artist/sigmar-polke), and Konrad Lueg (later to become the dealer Konrad Fischer) not as a movement, but rather as a send-up. Its most iconic expression was a performance titled “Living with Pop – A Demonstration for Capitalist Realism,” orchestrated by Richter and Lueg in the Berges department store in Dusseldorf that same year. The artists invited patrons to come view “what is hailed in America as the greatest breakthrough in art since Cubism,” as an advertisement for the event proclaimed. Puzzled visitors arrived to find the artists making themselves at home in a staged and decidedly average living room (Richter was reading a mystery novel). Of course Capitalist Realism had no such reputation in the U.S.; the artists were parodying the overnight ascendance of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art), with its celebrity culture and embrace of everyday commodities, as well as the German craze for all things American. Against the backdrop of the Cold War and a divided Germany, the fake movement’s title also alluded to the Soviet doctrine of [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism). The concerns of so-called Capitalist Realism—heavy-handed irony, investigation of the political aspects of consumerism, and critique of popular culture—have been seen by some as predecessors to a German strain of Pop Art, though the existence thereof is, itself, debatable.",

In her own take on [Neoclassical](/gene/neoclassicism) renderings of landscapes and Biblical images, Koether painted a series based on 17th-century painter [Nicolas Poussin](/artist/nicolas-poussin)'s _The Four Seasons_. Using frenetic lines in contrast to Poussin's formal refined techniques, Koether reveals her contemporary view of the seasons and notes the context of the work, a theme also carried through in her display of the works, frequently meant to be site-specific.",

Stingily has used braids to materialize the historical and contemporary implications of black women’s hair, and more broadly, the physical alienation and exploitation. Structures of power emerge in unexpected presentations of familiar objects, highlighting disproportionate systemic limitation, physical violence, and [surveillance](/gene/surveillance). ",

Albers arrived at the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany in 1922, but was limited in the coursework she could pursue as certain disciplines were not taught to women.

At the Bauhaus she studied under painters [Paul Klee](/artist/paul-klee) and [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky), focusing on relationships between colors and the expressive potential of simple forms. She then married leading Bauhaus figure and renowned color theorist [Josef Albers](/artist/josef-albers) in 1925. In addition to frequent conversations with her many friends and colleagues, Albers drew inspiration from the pre-Columbian art she viewed during travels throughout Mexico and the Americas.",
