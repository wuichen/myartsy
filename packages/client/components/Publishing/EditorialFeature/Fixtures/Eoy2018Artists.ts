        "<blockquote>Whether they were experimenting with floating sculptures, investigating war zones, or pushing painting forward in bold new directions, artists in 2018 made exciting and eclectic contributions to the world. There are so many creative accomplishments to celebrate this year that narrowing our focus to the year’s 20 most influential artists was no easy task. The talents you’ll find here have undeniably changed our culture and have touched and inspired countless others who have followed their examples. In many cases, they’ve caused us to reconsider the very definitions of what art can look like, and what it can achieve. </blockquote>",

The works summoned the whole of art history, alluding to the deep structural biases against black artists and the nature of the art market, while also experimenting with pure abstraction and paintings of quietly otherworldly scenes of everyday people doing everyday things, like a woman walking a dog. </p><p>Additional accolades this year came with presentations at Cleveland’s FRONT Triennial and the Carnegie International. Marshall also mounted his first public sculpture: a pair of stacked brick cylinders installed in Des Moines, Iowa, that pay tribute to the 12 African-American lawyers who founded the National Bar Association in Des Moines in 1925 after they were denied membership to the American Bar Association. Though he’s already cemented his place in the contemporary art canon, Marshall continues to experiment, take risks, and push his painting forward. “The structure of my practice as an artist makes me feel like I’m completely free,” he <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-kerry-james-marshall-proves-greatest-living-artists">said</a> during the opening of his London exhibition with David Zwirner. “I’m totally free. I’m not restrained by anything or anybody—I don’t have a lack of knowledge, a lack of ability, to do any of the things that I want to do.”</p>',

Over the course of several decades, Piper has needled, prodded at, and brought definition to the essence of American racism, class divisions, and misogyny through provocative performances, installations, and two-dimensional works, as well as with her writings and teachings. She is also a highly accomplished philosopher, with Eastern philosophies and the work of Kant looming large across her practice. </p><p>This year, Piper was the first living artist in the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art">Museum of Modern Art</a>’s history to receive the institution’s entire sixth floor for a sprawling retrospective. The show included her best-known works, like performance documentation of <em>The Mythic Being: I Embody Everything You Most Hate and Fear</em> (1975), in which she assumed the stereotype of an angry black man, donning an afro and fake mustache and engaging people in the street in aggressive, confrontational behavior, and even staging a mugging. But it also highlighted her lesser-known abstract compositions and recordings of her guerilla dance performances in public spaces, which underline the received notions of propriety and order inscribed into the built environment. </p>',

In 2018, he and Gucci creative director and fashion icon Alessandro Michele opened “The Artist Is Present,” an immersive blockbuster exhibition at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/yuz-museum">Yuz Museum</a> in Shanghai. The extravaganza features work by more than 30 high-profile artists, including <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/kapwani-kiwanga">Kapwani Kiwanga</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/superflex">Superflex</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/xu-zhen-xu-zhen">Xu Zhen</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/sturtevant-1">Sturtevant</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/lawrence-weiner">Lawrence Weiner</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/josh-kline">Josh Kline</a>, and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/reena-spaulings">Reena Spaulings</a>—each of whom tests the limits of artistic authorship. And despite technically being out of the game, Cattelan has still been making work. For Art Basel Cities in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this year, he conceived <em>Eternity</em>. Enlisting <a href="https://www.artbasel.com/cities/catalog/Maurizio-Cattelan">help from locals</a>, he built a graveyard full of memorials in honor of people who are not yet dead.</p><p>“As an Italian, I am used to seeing plenty of ‘fake retirees,’” said Massimiliano Gioni, artistic director of the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/newmuseum">New Museum</a> and a longtime friend of the artist. “It’s a national sport and a serious financial plague: people feigning disabilities in order to collect pensions or retiring for the sole purpose of getting paid while still working illegally. As always, Maurizio plays with Italian stereotypes and exacerbates them. I have always thought he is a very rare example of a lazy overachiever, so he has managed to be somewhat busier since he has gone into retirement.…To borrow the title of a recent study by Elena Filipovic on Duchamp, ‘the apparently marginal activities’ of Maurizio Cattelan will turn out to be as important a part of his career as all the work he had done before his retirement.” </p>',

Soon after, she co-founded, with <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/miriam-schapiro">Miriam Schapiro</a>, the pioneering Feminist Art Program at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/gene/calarts">California Institute of the Arts</a>, encouraging her students through consciousness-raising sessions to create works inspired by their gendered experiences. This helped lead, in 1972, to the groundbreaking Womanhouse project, in which Chicago and Schapiro, along with their students and local artists, overtook a dilapidated house with site-specific installations that probed the often-confining combination of artmaking and domestic labor present in so many female artists’ practices.</p><p>Women’s exclusion from public discourse features in Chicago’s best-known work, <em>The Dinner Party</em> (1974–79), a triangular banquet table set to honor centuries of important women, from Sappho to <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/georgia-okeeffe">Georgia O’Keeffe</a>. Although it now enjoys a permanent home in a temple-like gallery at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/brooklyn-museum">Brooklyn Museum</a>, it was, for many years, regarded as little more than kitsch. </p><p>At her core, Chicago has endeavored to understand if the female experience can “be a pathway to the universal in the way male experience has been,” as she said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/arts/judy-chicago-miami.html">in a recent interview</a>. Though she long struggled for her own recognition and critical acceptance, the fruits of Chicago’s feminist labor can be clearly seen throughout our current culture, from <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/petra-collins">Petra Collins</a>’s menstruating vagina shirts to <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/carmen-winant">Carmen Winant</a>’s sensational <em>My Birth</em> (2018)—a clear homage to Chicago’s “The Birth Project” (1980–85)—and even the pink “pussy hats” worn at recent women’s marches. There’s a new world coming, indeed, and Chicago helped make it possible.</p>',

The Philadelphia-based artist started 2018 off strong with a winter show at New York’s Karma gallery. Even the exhibition title, “C-A-T Spells Murder,” promised plenty of irreverent fun. The exhibition was something of an oxymoron: thoughtful Instagram bait. In the middle of a room drenched in pink light, Da Corte turned a massive, orange foam-and-velvet cat on its head. This feline centerpiece was offset by a series of sculptures in neon and vinyl siding that turned simple motifs—a pie on a window sill, a spider’s web—into seductive signage. Across town, the artist’s film <em>Slow Graffiti </em>(2017) got its New York City debut in a summer group show at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/david-zwirner">David Zwirner</a>, “This Is Not a Prop.” And at Art Basel Cities in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this past September, Da Corte mounted a giant, inflatable Kermit the Frog in the middle of an old studio. </p>',

        '<p>Da Corte also produced one of the most-loved artworks at this year’s Carnegie International in Pittsburgh, where curator Ingrid Schaffner devoted an entire gallery to his exuberant work. At the center of the gallery, he erected a neon structure that resembled a cottage. Window boxes filled with neon flowers and jack-o-lanterns added sweet, illuminated touches. Inside, 57 of Da Corte’s films played on loop. It was surreal cinema: In one video, a platinum blonde played with knives as she chatted on the phone. In others, Da Corte dressed up in costumes that made him look like Mr. Rogers or the apple from Fruit of the Loom commercials. “His neon house positively glows with a love of music, movies, Mr. Rogers, muppets, Saturday morning cartoons, holiday schmalz, and works of contemporary art. At the same time it stands skeletal and alone,” Schaffner said, calling the work an “emotional and intense experience of American culture.”</p><p>It’s no surprise that Da Corte’s playful, campy style has captivated an audience that extends well beyond the art world (the musician St. Vincent is a fan, as well, tapping him to direct a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TPqUvy1vYU">vibrant music video</a> last year). Though the artist makes immersive, alluring eye candy, its strangeness saves it from becoming twee. His weird riffs on pop culture (he once <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-alex-da-corte-slim-shady-art-world-comeback">dressed up as Eminem</a> for a video) and old fables (he’s also impersonated Frankenstein) ask viewers to reconsider the media they consume daily and the characters who are part of the cultural lexicon.</p>',

Bruce knew about performance before we even had a word for it. If you’re interested in any new technology, he was there early, if not first.” Indeed, Nauman’s explorations into and reinventions of performance, sculpture, new media, and everything in between have opened up so many new avenues for contemporary art that any one moment in his oeuvre could lead to a lifetime of experimentation for another artist. (Nauman <a href="https://krollermuller.nl/en/bruce-nauman-a-cast-of-the-space-under-my-chair">cast the negative space under his seat</a> in the mid-1960s, for example, and today, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/rachel-whiteread">Rachel Whiteread</a> has made a career out of casting the negative spaces of houses, staircases, and smaller objects.) His influence is myriad, and it continues to ripple.</p>',

        '<p>Ironically, the spaces she critiques throughout her practice are gradually enhancing her mainstream popularity. This past October, the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/guggenheim">Guggenheim</a> awarded Leigh its prestigious Hugo Boss Prize. The month before, she opened her first solo exhibition at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/luhring-augustine">Luhring Augustine</a>, a blue-chip New York gallery. <em>Cupboard VIII </em>(2018), one of the show’s most impressive sculptures, stands over 10 feet tall. The piece resembles a monumental woman, comprising a brown stoneware torso, hands, and neck; a head that resembles an open pot; and a layered raffia skirt that fans out 10 feet in diameter. In the show, the figure demanded her own private space—viewers could walk around the massive, hooping form, but never peer inside. Leigh often incorporates disconcerting female heads into her work: Faces are missing eyes or replaced entirely with gaping holes. As a result, the pieces sacrifice specificity as they address larger ideas about identity; if her figures are more mythological than real, they <em>are</em> clearly black women. </p><p>Next year, Leigh’s work will get a further spotlight in the public sphere when she mounts a massive, 16-foot-tall bronze bust on the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/highlineart">High Line</a> park in New York. Leigh is an increasingly formidable presence in contemporary art, making the large-scale work apt for her outsize, revolutionary ambitions. “I’ve come to see her mute ceramic female figures as sentinels holding space for a culture that is very much in the making,” curator Helen Molesworth recently <a href="https://www.artforum.com/print/201803/helen-molesworth-on-the-work-of-simone-leigh-74304">wrote</a>, “a culture in which whiteness is neither the center nor the frame.”</p>',

Hockney created the painting after the end of a relationship, and there are competing interpretations about who the two figures in the painting are—whether the jacketed figure is Hockney looking down through the ripples of a swimming pool at his former lover swimming below, or his former lover gazing down at a new romantic partner, or nothing to do with their breakup at all (as his former lover has posited). Regardless of what it depicts, the painting represents two of Hockney’s most celebrated genres: his crystalline swimming pools and his double portraits, the latter capturing casual yet bold representations of individuals that vibrate with psychological connection. </p>',

In her best-known, breakout film, <em>Wildness </em>(2012), Tsang gives voice (literally) to the historic Los Angeles gay bar Silver Platter in MacArthur Park, long a gathering point for Latinos and, more recently, LGBT artists. (The artist herself ran a night at the club called “Wildness.”) In narrations, the bar itself recounts its life as a refuge for marginalized peoples. She also invited some of the Silver Platter’s trans clientele to perform in her film <em>Damelo Todo/Odot Olemad</em> (2010–15)—shown at the U.K.’s Nottingham Contemporary last year—in which they staged the story of a Salvadorian teenager who leaves the country amid civil war and winds up in L.A. </p>',

        '<p>Tsang has become a consistently strong and influential figure in contemporary art and activism, earning a prestigious MacArthur Genius award this year. She is recognized as much for being an innovator in the medium of documentary film—where she blurs the borders between fact and fiction—as she is for being a powerful, searing voice among non-binary artists. Her films not only spotlight gender-nonconforming communities, they also bend time and genre. In <em>Into a Space of Love </em>(2018), an experimental documentary for which she partnered with Gucci this year (and which debuted at Frieze New York in May), Tsang explores the history of 1980s and ’90s house music in New York, touching on issues of gentrification and the cultural appropriation of queer communities; in it, she imagines iconic club performers from different eras coexisting in the film’s experimental present. </p><p>Her film <em>Girl Talk</em> (2015) also featured prominently in the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/newmuseum">New Museum</a>’s exhibition “Trigger: Gender as a Tool and a Weapon,” which closed earlier this year. It depicts the revered poet and theorist Fred Moten wearing a crystal-encrusted gown and spinning dreamily in a garden to the soulful jazz singing of Josiah Wise. Tsang’s most frequent collaborator, though, is the artist <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/boychild">boychild</a>, who creates otherworldly, sci-fi-inflected performances in which her muscular, gender-ambiguous body is often the center. The pair performed just this past month at Faena Forum in Art Basel in Miami Beach—Tsang playing the piano and singing, while boychild performed a rendition of “Carmen” from the famous opera of the same name. </p>',

He also enlisted a team of hundreds of spiders to cast silk webs around the space—with the insects prompted to mobilize, in theory, by a vibrational frequency produced from gravitational waves. He also showed new work at New York’s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/tanya-bonakdar-gallery">Tanya Bonakdar Gallery</a> that offered visitors the chance to imagine environmentally symbiotic travel, such as the <em>Aerocene Float Predictor</em>, which employs wind-forecast data to enable visitors to create wind-propelled flight trajectories. </p><p>More recently, at Art Basel in Miami Beach, Saraceno planted a series of upturned, solar-power-capturing umbrellas along the beach that fueled a giant air-filled kite into the air. In Saraceno’s ongoing invitation to tread lightly on the Earth, and to feel a closer bond to our fellow terrestrial species, his work feels achingly urgent. In January, the artist will make his debut in a part of the world that is already feeling the effects of our widespread exploitation of the environment—Los Angeles, where Tanya Bonakdar has a newly opened space.</p>',

The high-low, photo-ready aesthetic he has been peddling for more than two decades has now meshed perfectly with our life-on-Instagram moment; with over 1 million followers on the platform, the artist has built an audience for himself that exceeds what any gallery could provide. And while plenty of artists collaborate with fashion lines, Murakami takes the cake: 15 years after Marc Jacobs recruited him to design what became a hugely popular and influential Louis Vuitton bag, Murakami is more ubiquitous than ever, designing low-priced duds for Uniqlo and T-shirts for Abloh’s Off-White line that now sell to hypebeasts on Grailed for $650. The artist, quite simply, is everywhere—even in the recent Drake collaboration with former foe Meek Mill, in which Drake raps about having “a lot of Murakami in the hallway.” </p><p>But the busy Murakami is just as active in the white cube. He had so many gallery shows in 2018, it was as if the sun never set on one of his exhibitions. The collaborations with Abloh may have garnered a <em>mixed</em> critical response, to say the least, but a solo show at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/perrotin">Perrotin</a>’s New York outpost this spring was ambitious enough to fill multiple floors of the Lower East Side building that the Paris-born gallery took over in 2017. The most wowing works were gigantic diptychs that nodded to the work of <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/francis-bacon">Francis Bacon</a>.

The canvas features splotchy yellow and blue shapes, floating in a creamy field. Highly textured with intricately built-up layers, the composition is both cheery and infinitely complex: Each brushstroke possesses its own character. </p><p>Born in Chicago in 1925, Mitchell advocated for the unlimited potential of gestural abstraction. This past fall, New York gallery <a href="https://www.artsy.net/cheim-and-read">Cheim &amp; Read</a> mounted an exhibition of her work spanning 1953 to 1962. From the beginning of her career, the show posited, the virtuosic Mitchell had already landed on her signature style: energetic oil brushstrokes and delicate drips; swirling centers that calm toward the canvas edges; and abstracted natural motifs that suggest fields, flowers, and bodies of water. </p>',

Collaborating with the Society of Friends of Halit and using a combination of research, simulations, and architectural renderings, a collective known as <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/forensic-architecture">Forensic Architecture</a> had been piecing together the events that took place the day he was shot.

Forensic Architecture has proved that artists’ truth-seeking and ability to think outside of the box, combined with an interdisciplinary approach, can yield results in the real world. The evidence the collective has amassed on human rights abuses has been used in court cases around the world. </p>',

Tillmans makes a fitting contributor to an opera that reflects on global conflict and old national divisions; the artist has been one of Europe’s most outspoken critics against Brexit and the rise of the right wing across the continent and further afield. His concern with the issue instigated him to embark on a research project about our so-called post-truth world; his book <em>What Is Different?</em>—a collection of interviews with journalists, politicians, social workers, and scientists about the human response to falsehoods—was published this year by David Zwirner Books.

Many contemporary painters look to her, Hankins said, because “she is fearless in both her formal vocabulary and in the things she’s looking at.”</p>',

The comic undertones of von Heyl’s work, by contrast, largely take the guise of formalist jokes, but offer little irony.</p><p>With “Snake Eyes,” the largest survey of von Heyl’s work in the United States (the show traveled from the Deichtorhallen Hamburg in the artist’s home country), Hankins hopes to reorient the narrative of von Heyl as an artist without a style. Although she doesn’t follow a chronological or linear narrative in the way she makes her paintings, “there is a consistency in her work,” Hankins contended. “Every painting is a unique challenge to tackle when standing in front of the canvas.” This openness also makes von Heyl appealing to artists, she continued, especially “the idea that you can have a cohesive body of work that at the same time challenges how we conventionally talk about the arc of an artist’s career.”</p>',

In it, the artist brings to light the political contributions of over 5,000 board members at more than 125 art institutions across the United States. Among her discoveries was the frequency with which board members have donated to Republican causes—underlining the tension between the progressive values generally upheld by the art world (freedom of speech, equality, and human rights) and those of a political party whose establishment is increasingly moving towards the far right, driving forward a hardline immigration agenda, privileging corporations over individuals and the environment, and supporting a president who has called the press “the enemy of the American people.” </p><p>In addition to creating a powerful resource that surfaces the fraught relationship between culture and money, Fraser—who has been a crucial proponent of institutional critique throughout her career—herself joined the board of an institution this year: the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/ica-la">Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles</a>. And in addition to her ongoing teaching at UCLA, where she is an influential voice on the faculty, she has on view a graphic representation of her research from <em>2016 in Museums, Money, and Politics </em>at this year’s Shanghai Biennale. Fraser remains one of the most cogent and insightful voices challenging the art world from within.</p>',

It wouldn’t be wrong to think of Bock as a kind of B-movie <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/matthew-barney">Matthew Barney</a>, creating similarly hermetic, wild universes that cross media (but with considerably more of a sense of humor).</p><p>2018 brought a suite of exhibitions for the artist, including “Dead + Juicy” at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/anton-kern-gallery">Anton Kern Gallery</a> in New York, which opened, very appropriately, on Halloween. Bock gave the gallery’s elegant Midtown townhouse a campy makeover, installing a decrepit shed in its front space and building a bizarro bar area decorated with misshapen, hanging sculptures. The show’s centerpiece was a film by the same name, shot in Austin, Texas. Much of its action unfolds in a barbershop; a particularly indelible scene features one of the protagonists slowly shaving a taxidermied rat. </p>',

        '<p>The <a href="https://www.artsy.net/fondazione-prada">Fondazione Prada</a> in Milan, Italy, also hosted Bock’s “The Next Quasi-Complex” this year, an exhibition of over-the-top installations and sculptures that coincided with a tongue-in-cheek “lecture” dubbed <em>When I’m Looking into the Goat Cheese Baiser</em> (2001). And in November, at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/spruth-magers">Sprüth Magers</a> in Berlin, the artist debuted <em>Unheil (Mischief)</em> (2018), a new, dread-soaked, feature-length film set in the Dark Ages. </p><p>Perhaps Bock’s most salient achievement is bringing a Hollywood-style level of production to bear on themes that are decidedly esoteric. His exhibitions, with all their glorious mess and sprawl, provide a peek into the artist’s process—and brain—with film sets and props repurposed as sculptural environments meant to be wandered through and marveled over. </p>',

Rarely, if ever, has a presidential portrait received quite so much fanfare. It was the first time African-American artists had been selected for the honor of representing the president and first lady, and both artists moved the dial. Breaking from the more stiff, dull convention of portraiture that typifies presidential portraits of old, Wiley rendered Barack Obama against a hyperreal, abundant backdrop of vines and flowers.</p><p>The artist has, for some 17 years, proudly placed ordinary black Americans into the history of art—often “street casting” subjects and placing them in what have been referred to as “power portraits” that evoke the lavish style and tradition of canonizing aristocrats and politicians in European portraiture. For this intensely high-profile commission, Wiley depicted Barack Obama leaning forward slightly in a wooden chair, arms crossed, and surrounded—almost consumed—by a thicket of encroaching vines. He is engaged and alert, as though ruminating on a brief or intently listening to the words of his advisors.</p>',

        '<p>This is the president not as a monument of poise and power, but one who is active, bringing all of his intellect and energy to the task of grappling with the country’s challenges. The flowers that emerge from the greenery are symbolic—African blue lilies a nod to Barack’s Kenyan roots, chrysanthemums for the Obamas’ longtime home of Chicago, and jasmine to represent Hawaii, the former president’s birthplace—but they also disrupt the masculine tropes of power, suggesting the softer model of leadership that President Obama often cultivated. </p><p>The portraits received so much interest that they helped the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., smash its attendance records this year, drawing in over 2 million visitors in the last fiscal year, a large proportion of them millennials and Gen Z-ers. And Wiley was bestowed with the W.E.B. Du Bois medal, one of Harvard University’s most esteemed honors, alongside other black luminaries: comedian Dave Chappelle, art collector Pamela Joyner, and NFL player and activist Colin Kaepernick. Wiley also unveiled new, regal portraits of everyday black St. Louisans at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/stlartmuseum">Saint Louis Art Museum</a> later in the year. Now, he will leverage his considerable influence to place a spotlight on the Nigerian art scene; he has plans to open a studio in Lagos.</p>',
