      "<p>The landscape of contemporary art is ever-changing. It shifts according to countless factors, from artists’ principles and the political climate to auction records and collectors’ tastes. Nevertheless, each year, a new crop of ambitious artists stands out. They catapult from obscurity to ubiquity, earn representation from top galleries, garner interest from prominent collectors, and pack their schedules with exhibitions. Most importantly, they make work that expands our understanding of what art can be. </p><p>The Artsy Vanguard 2019 features 50 artists, hailing from 27 countries and working in 27 cities around the world. Ranging in age from 28 to 93, they pursue painting, sculpture, photography, filmmaking, and performance, as well as investigative research and virtual reality. They delve into topics from human rights violations to youth culture, and capture the attention of powerhouse collectors and celebrity royalty, like Beyoncé. </p><p><i>Artsy </i>editors developed this list from a pool of 600 artists who were nominated by more than 100 curators, collectors, and art-world professionals. These artists represent three distinct career stages, which we’ve arranged into the following categories: Emerging, which introduces artists who recently started showing at leading institutions and galleries; Newly Established, which presents the artists making noise at major art events and gaining representation with influential galleries; and Getting Their Due, which recognizes artists who have worked persistently for decades, yet have only recently received the spotlight they deserve. The Artsy Vanguard highlights the artists paving the future of art <i>right now</i>.</p>",

She imagines “parallel universes that are both terrifying, fascinating, and otherworldly…until you realize that they are not so far from the actual world we live in,” Gavaldon said. Like an archaeologist, he continued, Al Qadiri unearths tiny fragments of a future that is already here. </p><p>Formerly a member of the artist collective <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/gcc">GCC</a>, Al Qadiri has increasingly gained attention for her personal practice. In 2018, she participated in the Athens Biennial, the Luleå Biennial, and the Asia Pacific Triennial. Earlier this year, she debuted a large outdoor sculpture at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/pinchukartcentre/">PinchukArtCentre</a>’s Future Generation Art Prize <a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/pinchukartcentre-exhibition-of-21-shortlisted-artists-for-the-future-generation-art-prize-2019">exhibition</a> in Venice.

They meld together “a spectrum of influences from the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-alabama-women-made-quilts-modern-art">Gee’s Bend quilters</a> of Alabama to the Unicorn Tapestries that were produced during the turn of the 16th century in Paris,” Christovale noted, while also invoking America’s history of slavery through his use of cotton. “Both his technique and context work together to highlight a black and queer experience in today’s society,” she added.</p>',

It’s a perspective that underlies his video work, where realities and fictions commingle, and identities and interactions are performed. In stilted, melodramatic scenes brought to life by actors, Tao creates fragments of narratives that hold a flame to our media-saturated world. In <em>Joint Images</em> (2016), a man and woman engage in hammy dialogue while a soap opera on the television behind them mirrors their scripted conversation. In <em>Double Talk </em>(2018), the ghost of a K-pop star reflects upon his life and legacy while a classroom of children watch through a screen.</p>',

In 2018, Tao had solo shows at The Breeder in Athens and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/chi-wen-gallery-chi-wen-gallery-at-asia-now-2018">Chi-Wen Gallery</a> in Taipei. This year, he is shortlisted for Hong Kong institution <a href="https://www.artsy.net/m-plus">M+</a>’s inaugural Sigg Prize; had a solo show at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/edouard-malingue-gallery">Edouard Malingue Gallery</a>; and was picked up by Berlin gallery <a href="https://www.artsy.net/esther-schipper">Esther Schipper</a>, placing him alongside an impressive roster of international artists.

Geng was featured in the 2018 Biennale of Sydney and the 2019 Venice Biennale, where her work is currently on view in the Chinese national pavilion. There, her film <em>The Name of Gold </em>(2019) has captivated audiences with its animated exploration of reincarnation. In it, stick figures made from clay give birth or engage in death rituals. In late 2019, Geng will have a solo exhibition at the Zhuzhong Art Museum in Beijing.</p>',

This time, she’s focusing on teens who go to French schools in Morocco that date back to colonial times. Bennani briefly pulled out of the exhibition to protest Whitney vice chairman Warren Kanders, but decided to stay after <a href="https://www.artsy.net/news/artsy-editorial-warren-kanders-steps-position-whitney-museum-trustee-amid-protests">his resignation</a>. Bennani was recently picked up by the Brussels- and Brooklyn-based gallery <a href="https://www.artsy.net/c-l-e-a-r-i-n-g">Clearing</a>, and currently has a solo exhibition at their New York space. In October, she’ll have a solo exhibition at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/fondation-louis-vuitton">Fondation Louis Vuitton</a> in Paris, and in 2020, she’ll show at the Julia Stoschek Collection in Berlin. </p>',

Looking at them, you wouldn’t know that Solano went blind at age 26. Losing their sight didn’t stop the artist from continuing to paint.

                '<p>Over the past two years, enthusiasm for Fordjour has only grown. The <a href="https://www.artsy.net/whitneymuseum">Whitney Museum of American Art</a> commissioned him to create a <a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/whitney-museum-of-american-art-1-derek-fordjour-half-mast">mural</a>, <em>Half Mast</em> (2018), in which he addresses gun violence; the Brooklyn Academy of Music featured one of his paintings; and Miami’s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/nina-johnson">Nina Johnson</a> gallery gave him a solo show. He joined the roster of Los Angeles’s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/night-gallery">Night Gallery</a> last year and had a solo exhibition there this past spring. In April, New York’s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/petzel-gallery">Petzel Gallery</a> announced that it would be representing Fordjour, too. He’s also garnered the support of American royalty: Jay-Z and Beyoncé. At Frieze New York this past May, the pop star purchased Fordjour’s <em>Top-Ten ALLSTARS </em>(2019), a series of 10 portraits. His first major solo museum exhibition will open in 2020 at the Contemporary Art Museum, St. Louis. </p><p>The hype is well-earned. CAM St. Louis chief curator Wassan Al-Khudhairi noted that Fordjour’s work is “immediately attractive,” with moving undertones that are at times dark. “His uniformed figures represent a longing to be a part of something, yet a basic unfairness persists,” Al-Khudhairi explained. “Fordjour’s subtle appeal to viewers, persuading them toward difficult subject matter, stands out in our very unsubtle moment in history.”</p>',

Her work has taken her deep into the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/lacma">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a>’s collection of ancient Mexican ceramics, analyzing how the meaning of such objects changed upon entering the context of an art museum. She’s also researched Zapotec, an ancient Mexican language, to consider the boundaries between visual language and drawing. These inquiries, informed by a master’s degree in Latin American studies, culminate in paintings and sculpture. </p>',

The following March, his work was in demand at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/michael-kohn-gallery">Kohn Gallery</a>’s booth at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/kohn-gallery-kohn-gallery-at-the-armory-show-2019">The Armory Show</a>; the Los Angeles gallery began representing the artist in 2017 (he also shows with Company Gallery in New York). In 2018, the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/lacma">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a> added a work by Chase to its collection; and during The Armory Show’s VIP preview this year, more institutions eagerly acquired his works, including Minneapolis’s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/walker-art-center">Walker Art Center</a> and the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/icamiami">Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami</a>. </p>',

Her subtly anthropomorphized “Grandmother Towers” are sculptural portraits of her late grandmother. One of the Korean artist’s sculptures—an arched construction resembling coffee tables or musical drums stacked into a craning formation—is a tender representation of her relative’s hunched-over spinal column. Imbued in these personal forms is the artist’s exploration of the relationship between individual and society; she sees her grandmother as an embodiment of Korea’s tumultuous recent history.</p>',

Her vaguely surrealistic scenes entail figures who get lost in private moments on cell phones, or in substance-induced oblivion while objects take on a sinister quality. An atmospheric tension pervades the scenes, curdling the air. Valérie Knoll, who curated Mulleady’s 2017 show at Kunsthalle Bern, noted that the artist’s paintings lure us “into worlds infiltrated by an air of violence and uncanniness.” She added, “They are intense, sexual, cold, and often nightmarish.”</p>',

This year alone, they have gone on view at Berlin’s Galerie Neu, in Art Basel in Basel’s Statements section, and at the Venice Biennale’s “<a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/58th-venice-biennale-may-you-live-in-interesting-times">May You Live in Interesting Times</a>,” where the Swiss-Uruguayan artist is showing two series inspired by <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/edvard-munch">Edvard Munch</a>’s “Frieze of Life” series. In one, <em>Exterior with Goats</em> (2019), a young woman wanders in a semi-tropical landscape at night alongside prancing goats, while volcanoes simmer in the background. In another, street figures in the glow of L.A.’s golden hour appear engaged in various states of depravity, crisis, or repose. Mulleady, who is represented by Freedman Fitzpatrick and Galerie Neu, is opening a solo show at New York’s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/swissinstitute">Swiss Institute</a> in late September. The show is certain to reinforce her profile as a strong emerging painter. </p>',

Though the artist has shown with mega-gallery <a href="https://www.artsy.net/white-cube">White Cube</a> since 2015, he’s currently in the spotlight as his paintings earn much-deserved acclaim at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/58th-venice-biennale-may-you-live-in-interesting-times">Venice Biennale</a>.

DiQuinzio pointed to Armitage’s riffs on <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/paul-gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>, challenging “the exoticization of the ‘other’ that Gauguin problematically represented.” This year, Armitage also had a solo show at Turin’s Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, and was included in “<a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/mca-chicago-prisoner-of-love">Prisoner of Love</a>” at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/mcachicago">Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago</a>.</p>',

His “earwitness testimony” translates witness descriptions of sound effects “like somebody dropping a rack of trays” to the ricochet of a gunshot. The work has political currency: Abu Hamdan developed the project with <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/forensic-architecture">Forensic Architecture</a> and Amnesty International for use in legal investigations and advocacy for humanitarian rights. “He has been able to shift the discourse around how we listen and interrogate why we listen,” Kholeif said.</p>',

Their signature works investigate youth culture and marginalized communities through a multidisciplinary practice that integrates filmmaking, anthropology, performance, music, and dance.

In this newest work, the British artist juxtaposes breathtaking shots of nature with spoken anecdotes that sound like diary entries about queer relationships and sexual encounters. The viewer must work out the connections between the disembodied voice, personal stories, and the landscape on screen. Brief pauses in the dialogue offer time for additional contemplation and looking.

Much of her work is, in one way or another, channeling this heritage, and is based in an understanding that “knowledge is ultimately produced through rituals and oral histories,” said Sofía Hernández Chong Cuy, director of Witte de With.</p><p>The artist engages in her own forms of myth-making, via oil-stick murals and paintings of elastic figures that are surrounded by (and nearly inseparable from) illumination-like patterns in a minimal palette of cool blues and pastels. Sometimes, she combines them with installations of hanging façades with ornamental borders redolent of Islamic doorways. But it’s not just imaginary human subjects and architectures that populate Kara’s oeuvre; she has a penchant for representing animals, too—in the form of carved wooden sculptures of dogs, or armadillos decorated with ornamentation and stacked atop one another in idiosyncratic formation.</p>",

Her paintings are imaginative, science fiction–tinged depictions of metropolises that merge Eastern and Western aesthetics. Taking architecture and furniture as source material, the artist abstracts the structures to develop novel compositions. Paintings feature chair spindles broken apart into spirals, and tubes that float against a brushy background. Aidan Li, head of the K11 Art Foundation, noted that Cui “is one of the most talented painters of her generation.” </p>',

They were looking at me as much as I was looking at them, and I felt an immediate visceral connection with the work.” The show’s title, which translates to “I am an island,” draws on Sánchez’s personal narrative as an islander, a gay female artist, and a woman who has persevered through time. </p>',

                '<p><a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/tishan-hsu">Tishan Hsu</a>’s multimedia work from the 1980s and ’90s radiates a dingy, lo-fi buzz. His muted paintings feature bumps, orifices, and ridges that suggest bodies in fragments or seen through an X-ray. Some paintings protrude from the wall, given dynamic heft with layered styrofoam; a number of sculptures integrate similar corporeal motifs with bathroom tiles, carts, and cages. Looking at Hsu’s work, one might think of hospitals, basements, and old-timey computer parts. The artist has “anticipated so many concerns that younger artists are dealing with in their work today,” said <a href="https://www.artsy.net/whitneymuseum">Whitney Museum of American Art</a> curator Christopher Y. Lew, “especially in relation to technology and the body.” Lew added that he believes Hsu is a role model for Asian-Americans in the art world.</p>',

Working with unconventional materials like glitter, talcum powder, and perfume, the African-American artist affixes her unstretched canvases to the wall with nails in a relaxed and sumptuous pose. These tactile paintings underlie the labor-intensive practices that the artist employs to make them: Whole canvases are composed of obsessively hole-punched paper dots, or violently cut and sewn back together.

In the latter piece, volunteers held up empty picture frames for the people of color watching the parade to consider themselves as art.

The artist went on to display the results through a series of objects, including a colorful indigenous yarn grid (or <em>quipu</em>). Her brightly painted, two-dimensional female bodies from 1967 appear playful, but are meant to parody ideals of femininity. Most impressive of Burga’s practice is that she has been questioning technology and information in her art since the 1970s. A pioneer of installation, media, and technology-driven art, Burga was also a founding member of the 1960s avant-garde group Arte Nuevo, known for producing <a href="https://www.artsy.net/gene/happenings">Happenings</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/gene/op-art">Op art</a>, and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/gene/pop-art">Pop art</a>. </p>',

She also shows with Galerie Barbara Thumm and 80m2 Livia Benavides. Migros director Heike Munder emphasized that Burga was often ahead of her time: “Her playfulness and comments on gender issues are outstanding even today,” Munder said. “The unifying constant in the artist’s formally and aesthetically diverse output in a wide range of media is her insistent endeavor to visualize complex social structures, but also the individual’s capacity for practical self-determination. Although Burga does not see herself as an openly political artist, her work is a probing exploration of modern society.”</p>',

After creating art for six decades, Armajani received <a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/walker-art-center-siah-armajani-follow-this-line">his first American retrospective</a> at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/walker-art-center">Walker Art Center</a> in Minneapolis last year, which then traveled to the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/metmuseum">Met Breuer</a> this past February. That same month, his seminal installation <em>Bridge Over Tree</em> (1970) was re-staged in Brooklyn by the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/publicartfund">Public Art Fund</a> (PAF). Using basic construction and materials, Armajani’s bridge challenges our notions of nature and will. PAF director and chief curator Nicholas Baume noted that the artist “transfigures everyday, utilitarian architectural forms into a poetic language, imbuing them with meaning beyond their conventional function.” </p>',

His sculptures, installations, and drawings investigate political speech, religious recitation, and an individual’s desire to publicly express themselves. “Before anyone else thought about immersive experiences and interactive installations, Siah produced major works that understood the unique context, possibilities, and responsibilities of public art in an open democracy,” said Baume.

From afar, his canvases look like painted, gridded abstractions, while suggesting hanging, knitted tapestries. Walk towards one, though, and each individual cell takes on a distinct texture, with subtle color variations throughout the composition. Binion’s works are made of paper, crayon, laser-printed images, and oil paint sticks; he builds them from personal documents, including copies of his birth certificate and pages from his address book. His oeuvre might be seen as a body of abstracted self-portraits, rendered with data. </p>',

Originally a figurative painter, González changed styles in the 1960s, creating vivid, colorblocked compositions based on mass media. In 1965, her painting <em>The Suicides of the Sisga I, II and III </em>was refused by the jury of the Salon of Colombian Artists. The artist has often dealt with violent unrest in her work, having come of age during a bloody era of Colombian history known as <em>La Violencia</em>.</p>',

She settled in California in 1980, started The Post-Apollo Press, and wrote and distributed experimental poetry and fiction. When not writing or publishing, Fattal has pursued an expansive art practice that includes painting, collage, and sculpture. She may be best known for her ceramics, which suggest truncated human figures and archeological ruins—forms that seem to echo the destruction and violence of her past. A love for narrative is evident in Fattal’s visual work. Ruba Katrib, curator of “<a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/moma-ps1-simone-fattal-works-and-days">Works and Days</a>,” the recently closed retrospective of Fattal’s work at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/moma-ps1">MoMA PS1</a>, remarked that the artist “reconsiders how stories are told.”</p>',

                '<p>In the early 1980s, painter <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/vivian-suter">Vivian Suter</a> renounced the art world. Instead of hustling in major metropolises and fraternizing with dealers, she opted for a peaceful existence on the edge of a Guatemalan lake and focused on her practice. Suter arrived at a signature style: free-hanging canvases tacked to the wall or dangling from the ceiling, featuring brushy, bright, abstract designs. They suggest islands, trees, leaves, and large topographies. Her indoor and outdoor presentations envelop the viewer in soothing forms. And she’s made something of a triumphant return to the art world in recent years. </p>',

Maiolino’s first retrospective, at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/pinacoteca">Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo</a>, premiered in 2005. In 2017, she had a <a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/moca-los-angeles-anna-maria-maiolino">major retrospective</a> at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/moca">Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles</a>. This year, the artist—who shows with <a href="https://www.artsy.net/hauser-and-wirth">Hauser &amp; Wirth</a>, Galeria Luisa Strina, and Galleria Raffaella Cortese—had a solo show at <a href="https://www.artsy.net/pac-milano">Padiglione d’Arte Contemporanea</a> in Milan; a new survey of her work will debut at London’s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/whitechapel-gallery">Whitechapel Gallery</a> in late September. </p>',
